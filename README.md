### Description:
This is a simple Express.js server that keeps track of books using a text file called `books.txt`. It has three main features: adding a new book while making sure all details are complete and the ISBN hasnâ€™t been used yet, finding a specific book by its ISBN and author, and listing all books written by a certain author. The server reads from and writes to the text file to store the book records and listens for requests on port 3000.
